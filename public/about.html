  <h3>Welcome to my world, where mathematical engineering meets software innovation!</h3>

  <p>
    With a foundation in mathematical engineering and embedded software, my journey has been a dynamic blend of uncovering hidden patterns and trends, ones that often escape the conventional lens. My early foray into software engineering led me to the defense industry, where I had the honor of crafting code that powers cutting-edge 4x4 armored vehicles like "Yoruk", "Ejder Yalcin", "Ejder Toma", and "Ejder Kunter", in partnership with Nurol Makina.

  <p>
    From there, my career took a leap into the realms of gaming and e-commerce, where I transitioned into leadership roles as a Project Manager and Data Analyst Manager, driving significant improvements in performance metrics. My analytical journey continued at Hepsiburada.com as a Commercial Planning Analyst, followed by Delivery Hero, where I contributed as a Product Operations Analyst.

  <p>
    Currently, I’m channeling my analytical expertise as an Operational Analyst with GetYourGuide, but my love for solving complex problems and building creative solutions is pushing me towards a new challenge: Full Stack Development. I’m now immersed in building websites and applications, eager to combine my data-driven mindset with full-stack development skills to create seamless and efficient digital experiences.

    Stay tuned as I continue to grow and explore the endless possibilities of web development!
