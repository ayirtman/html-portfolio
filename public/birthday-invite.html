  <h3>What to bring:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Balloons (Seriously, bring ALL the balloons. I’m aiming for liftoff!)</li>
    <li>Beer (Because hydration is important, right?)</li>
    <li>Your best dance moves (There will be judgment... and prizes)</li>
    <li>A joke (I’m collecting new material for awkward silences)</li>
    <li>And, of course, an unreasonable amount of fun!</li>
  </ul>
    
  
  <h3>This is where you need to go:</h3>
